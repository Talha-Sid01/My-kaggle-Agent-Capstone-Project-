🩺 Healthage: AI Symptom Triage Agent

Capstone Project: A Multi-Agent System for preliminary healthcare triage using Google Gemini.

📖 Overview

Healthage is an intelligent, multi-agent web application designed to bridge the gap between "Googling symptoms" and seeing a doctor.

In the current healthcare landscape, patients often struggle to interpret their symptoms, leading to unnecessary panic or delayed treatment. This project acts as an automated First-Response Triage Assistant. It uses Generative AI to parse natural language, assesses urgency using clinical heuristics, and retrieves trusted medical summaries to empower users with immediate, actionable guidance.

✨ Key Features

🗣️ Natural Language Understanding: Users can describe symptoms freely (e.g., "My baby has a high fever and isn't eating").

🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration:

Extractor Agent: Parses unstructured text into JSON (Symptoms, Severity, Duration).

Triage Agent: Determines urgency level (Self-Care, See Doctor, Emergency).

Retriever Agent: Fetches verified medical summaries from trusted sources.

🚦 Visual "Thinking" Process: The UI visualizes the AI's step-by-step reasoning in real-time.

🛡️ Safety Guardrails: Hardcoded overrides for critical keywords (e.g., "Unconscious") ensure safety.

🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a Split-Stack Monorepo architecture, deploying the frontend and backend as separate services that communicate via REST API.

🚀 Getting Started Locally

Follow these instructions to run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites

Python 3.9+

Node.js (v18+) & npm

A Google AI Studio API Key

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/Talha-Sid01/My-kaggle-Agent-Capstone-Project-.git](https://github.com/Talha-Sid01/My-kaggle-Agent-Capstone-Project-.git)
cd My-kaggle-Agent-Capstone-Project-


2. Backend Setup (Python)

Navigate to the backend folder and set up the environment.

cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up API Key (Create a .env file)
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env

# Run the Server
uvicorn main:app --reload


The backend will start at http://localhost:8000

3. Frontend Setup (React)

Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder.

cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up Environment Variable
# Create a .env file to point to your local backend
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env

# Run the Frontend
npm run dev


The frontend will start at http://localhost:5173
